## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Git repository
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- OpenAI API key (for commit messages and PR descriptions)
- **One of the following**:
  - **SDK Mode**: Anthropic API key (for direct API access)
  - **CLI Mode**: Claude Code CLI installed (for Claude Max users)

## Installation

```bash
npm i -g @ariso-ai/ivan
```

## Configuration

Ivan will automatically prompt for configuration on first use. You can also reconfigure at any time:

```bash
# Reconfigure API keys and settings
ivan reconfigure
```

### Configuration includes:
- **Executor Type**: Choose between SDK (API-based) or CLI (Claude Max) mode
- **OpenAI API Key**: For generating commit messages and PR descriptions
- **Anthropic API Key**: For Claude Code execution (SDK mode only)
- **Repository Instructions**: Optional coding guidelines specific to each repository
- **Tool Permissions**: Configure which tools Claude Code can use per repository
- **Model Selection**: Choose which Claude model to use for tasks

Configuration is stored in `~/.ivan/config.json` and the database in `~/.ivan/db.sqlite`

### Executor Modes

Ivan supports two ways to run Claude Code:

#### SDK Mode (Default)
- Uses the Anthropic API directly via TypeScript SDK
- Requires an Anthropic API key
- Best for users with API access

#### CLI Mode
- Uses the Claude Code CLI installed on your machine
- Perfect for Claude Max subscribers (no API key needed)
- Provides real-time streaming output
- Requires Claude Code CLI to be installed

**Switch between modes at any time:**
```bash
# Configure executor type
ivan configure-executor

# View current executor setting
ivan show-config
```

## Usage

### Running Tasks

#### Interactive Mode

Simply run `ivan` in any git repository:

```bash
ivan
```

Then describe what you want to accomplish. Ivan will:
1. Break down your request into individual tasks
2. Ask if you want to wait for PR reviews after completion
3. Execute each task using Claude Code
4. Create pull requests with proper commits and AI-generated review instructions
5. Optionally wait 30 minutes and automatically address any PR comments

#### Non-Interactive Mode (Headless)

Run Ivan with a task description directly from the command line:

```bash
# Provide task description as an argument
ivan "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"

# Skip the review waiting prompt (don't wait for PR reviews)
ivan "Refactor the database module" --no-wait

# Wait for PR reviews after completion
ivan "Add comprehensive test coverage" --wait-for-reviews
```

Non-interactive mode is perfect for:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated workflows
- Scripting and automation
- Running Ivan from other tools

### CLI Commands

#### Main Commands

```bash
# Run Ivan to execute tasks (default command)
ivan

# Reconfigure API keys and settings
ivan reconfigure

# Address PR review comments and failing checks
ivan address

# Start the web interface
ivan web [--port <port>]

# Stop the web interface
ivan web-stop [--port <port>]
```

#### Repository Configuration

```bash
# Set or update repository-specific instructions
ivan edit-repo-instructions

# Configure allowed tools for Claude Code in current repository
ivan config-tools

# Show current repository configuration
ivan show-config

# Choose which Claude model to use for tasks
ivan choose-model

# Configure executor type (SDK vs CLI)
ivan configure-executor
```

### Addressing PR Comments

Automatically handle PR review comments:

```bash
# Scan all open PRs for unaddressed comments and failing checks
ivan address

# Only process comments from a specific GitHub user
ivan address --from-user username

# Filter to comments from multiple users
ivan address --from-user user1 --from-user user2
```

This will:
1. Find all open PRs with unaddressed inline code comments
2. Let you select which PRs to address
3. Create tasks for each unaddressed comment
4. Automatically implement fixes using Claude Code
5. Commit changes with co-author attribution
6. Reply to each comment with the commit that fixed it
7. Add a review request with specific instructions

**Filtering by user**: The `--from-user` flag allows you to focus on comments from specific reviewers, which is useful when:
- Working with specific team members
- Prioritizing feedback from senior reviewers
- Processing comments in batches by reviewer

### Example Requests

- "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"
- "Refactor the database module to use TypeScript"
- "Add comprehensive test coverage for the API endpoints"
- "Implement a caching layer with Redis"
- "Fix all ESLint warnings and add proper error handling"

### Web Interface

Start the web server to monitor jobs and tasks:

```bash
# Start web server on default port 3000
ivan web

# Or specify a custom port
ivan web --port 8080

# Stop the web server
ivan web-stop
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see:
- All jobs and their status
- Individual task progress
- Execution logs
- Pull request links

### Repository-Specific Instructions

Set coding guidelines that will be automatically applied to every task:

```bash
# Set or update repository instructions
ivan edit-repo-instructions

# Instructions can include:
- Coding style preferences
- Framework-specific patterns
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards
```

**Note**: Ivan will prompt for instructions the first time you use it in a repository. If you decline, it won't ask again, but you can always configure them later using `ivan edit-repo-instructions`.

### Tool Configuration

Control which tools Claude Code can use in your repository:

```bash
# Configure allowed tools
ivan config-tools

# View current configuration
ivan show-config
```

By default, all tools are allowed. You can restrict to specific tools like `["Bash", "Read", "Write", "Edit"]` for enhanced security.

### Model Selection

Choose which Claude model to use for task execution:

```bash
# Select a Claude model
ivan choose-model
```

Available models:
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Default, balanced performance
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: Faster, good for simpler tasks
- **Claude Opus 4.1**: Most capable, but slower

## How It Works

### Standard Workflow
1. **Task Analysis**: Claude Code analyzes your request and breaks it into PR-ready tasks
2. **Review Options**: Asks if you want to wait for PR reviews (optional)
3. **Branch Creation**: Creates a new branch for each task (`ivan/task-description-timestamp`)
4. **Code Implementation**: Claude Code implements the changes using your repository context
5. **Smart Commits**: Generates conventional commit messages based on the actual changes
6. **Pull Request**: Creates a PR with detailed description and AI-generated review instructions
7. **Review Monitoring** (optional): Waits 30 minutes for reviews, then automatically addresses comments
8. **Cleanup**: Returns to main branch and syncs with upstream

### Address Workflow
1. **PR Scanning**: Finds all open PRs with unaddressed comments or failing checks
2. **Comment Detection**: Uses GitHub GraphQL API to find unresolved inline code comments
3. **Task Creation**: Creates address tasks for each comment with proper branch tracking
4. **Automated Fixes**: Implements fixes using Claude Code with repository context
5. **Smart Replies**: Replies to each comment with the commit that addressed it
6. **Review Requests**: Adds context-specific review instructions based on changes

## Database Schema

Ivan maintains a local SQLite database to track:
- **Jobs**: High-level user requests with timestamps and status
- **Tasks**: Individual tasks within a job, including:
  - Task description
  - Task type (build or address)
  - Execution status (not_started, active, completed)
  - Branch name tracking
  - Pull request links
  - Execution logs with tool calls
  - Timestamps

## Running Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ariso-ai/ivan.git
cd ivan

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Link globally for system-wide access
npm link

# Or run directly from the project directory
node dist/index.js
```

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Watch mode for development
npm run watch

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Type checking
npm run typecheck
```

## Advanced Features

### Execution Logs
- All Claude Code interactions are logged with tool calls
- Each response is separated with visual dividers for readability
- Tool inputs and outputs are captured for debugging
- Logs are stored in the database for each task

### Smart Review Comments
- PRs are created with AI-generated review instructions
- Review comments are specific to the changes made
- Uses GPT-4o-mini to analyze diffs and generate contextual review requests
- Replies to PR comments include "Ivan:" prefix for clear attribution

### Comment Detection
- Uses GitHub GraphQL API to detect resolved status
- Only processes unresolved inline code comments
- Ignores top-level PR comments
- Skips comments that already have replies

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored locally in `~/.ivan/config.json`
- No credentials are stored in the database
- Configuration prompts mask API key input
- Each task runs in the local environment with your git credentials
- GitHub CLI authentication is used for PR creation

## Limitations

- Requires GitHub CLI (`gh`) for pull request creation
- Works with GitHub repositories (GitLab/Bitbucket support planned)
- Tasks must be completable by Claude Code
- Requires active internet connection for AI services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**GitHub CLI not authenticated:**
```bash
gh auth login
```

**API keys not working:**
```bash
ivan reconfigure
```

**Claude CLI not found (CLI mode):**
```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI first
# See: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/installation

# Then configure Ivan to use CLI mode
ivan configure-executor
```

**Executor hanging or not showing output (CLI mode):**
- Ensure you're using the latest version of Claude Code CLI
- Try switching to SDK mode with `ivan configure-executor`
- Check that `claude --print` works independently

**Want to switch between SDK and CLI mode:**
```bash
# Switch executor type
ivan configure-executor

# View current configuration
ivan show-config
```

**Permission denied errors:**
- Ensure you have write access to the repository
- Check that your SSH keys are properly configured

**Web server issues:**
- Check if port is already in use
- Try a different port with `--port` flag
